# The Trends in Data Science

In this project I tried to create article that can help future data scientist to learn the right stack for their needs.

In this project, I use these library to help me manipulate the data and create the visualization:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- ScikitLearn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

File structure:
- `main.ipynb` file contains the code and the result of this project.
- `datasets` folder contains the raw data used for this project.

One of the most unique result of this project is that web development skill is essentials even you are a data scientist
