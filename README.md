# The Trends in Data Science

In this project I tried to create article that can help future data scientist to learn the right stack for their needs.

Libraries:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

File structure:
- `main.ipynb` file contains the code and the result of this project.
- `datasets` folder contains the raw data used for this project.

Summary:
- Web development skill is essentials even if you are data scientist
- Having microarchitecture skill sill be great advantage to levle up your career in data science.
- Deep learning skill is well-paid but it takes a lot of works to learn.
